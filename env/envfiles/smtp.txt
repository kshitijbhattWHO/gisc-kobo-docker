# NOTE: To send from GMail, the sending account must enable "Allowing less secure apps to access your account" (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).
# NOTE: To send from AWS EC2 instances, SNS must be used instead of SMTP. These and the SNS e-mail settings from `envfiles/aws.txt` are mutually exclusive; do not use both.
# See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/email/#smtp-backend.
